04 Feb 2026 - Day 1

Time spent: 3h

What I did today
• Initialized the first project Jane Joe portfolio for my 100 Days of Code challenge
• Completed Flexbox Froggy game for flexbox practice
• Created an initial roadmap of what I want to achieve during these 100 days
(this will evolve as I learn more)
• Set up daily time tracking to stay consistent

Notes
• Focus today was on getting started properly rather than rushing into advanced topics
• Priority for this challenge: consistency, fundamentals, and real projects

Next steps
• Continue working on the Jane Joe portfolio project
